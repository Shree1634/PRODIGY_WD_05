   - Visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and create a free account.  
   - Navigate to the "API Keys" section in your account and generate a new API key.

2. **Add Your API Key**:  
   - Open the `script.js` file in this project.  
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the API key you generated:  
     ```javascript
     const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
     ```

3. **Understand the API Call**:
